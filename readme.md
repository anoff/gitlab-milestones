## Usage

To use the webpack dev server run `npm run dev` inside the `web/` directory.

The page can be deployed to GitHub pages. To make sure the static links generated during the webpack build have the correct base url (e.g. user.github.io/myproject) set the `build.assetsPublicPath` variable in `web/config/index.js` to `myproject/`.

For building and publishing to github pages run:

```sh
npm run build
npm run deploy
```
